            <h3>My Childhood</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              My childhood is filled with simple joys, laughter, and innocence.
              I spent my days playing freely and learning basic values from my
              family. Those memories remain special because they built the
              foundation of who I am today.

            <h3>My Teenage Life</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              My teenage life is a time of self-discovery, learning, and change.
              I experience new responsibilities, friendships, and challenges
              that help shape who I am. Through both mistakes and successes, I
              grow more confident and independent.

            <h3>My Adulthood</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              My adulthood marks a stage of greater responsibility and maturity.
              I begin to make important decisions that affect my future and the
              people around me. Life becomes more challenging, but it also
              brings meaningful achievements. I learn to balance work,
              relationships, and personal growth. Through perseverance and
              experience, I continue striving for my goals.

            <p>
              Zayn Malik is my favorite artist because of his unique voice and
              emotional songs. I admire how his music expresses deep feelings
              and personal experiences. His songs are relaxing and inspiring,
              and they always help me feel calm and motivated whenever I listen
              to them.

            </figure>
            <p>
              Chicken Adobo is my favorite food because of its rich and savory
              flavor. I love how the chicken becomes tender after being cooked
              in soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and spices. It is a classic
              Filipino dish that reminds me of home and family meals, making it
              extra special to me.

            <p>
              Siargao is my favorite place because of its beautiful beaches and
              relaxing atmosphere. I love the clear blue waters, white sand, and
              peaceful surroundings. Visiting Siargao helps me unwind and enjoy
              nature, making it a perfect escape from a busy life.
